# SightWords

# My daughter's teacher pointed out that she needed practice with sight words. When I try to go over sight words with her, it is always met with "Mom, can we do math instead?" or any other excuse that she can muster up! To solve this problem I used my programming skills to create an app to make learning her sight words fun!
